### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rhyza

I'm a front end engineer based out of Brooklyn. In the past I've worked at Red Hat and Puppet.

I'm currently working on a passion project [Screen Patron](https://github.com/rhyza/screen-patron), a web app where you can find, share, and support local DIY film screenings.
