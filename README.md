### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rhyza

I'm a front end engineer based out of Brooklyn. In the past I've worked at Red Hat and Puppet. I'm always open to new opportunities. Feel free to look over my [resume](./Rhyza%20Velasco%20Resume.pdf) and reach out to me over email.

Cinematography is a hobby of mine and lately, I've been working on a passion project [Screen Patron](https://github.com/rhyza/screen-patron), a web app where you can find, share, and support local DIY film screenings. It's been fun working on everything from UX design to back end imeplementation. It's not quite ready yet but you can take a peek at how it currently looks [here](https://screen-patron.fly.dev/). You can read more about the tech stack if you're interested [here](https://github.com/rhyza/screen-patron/wiki).
